I got, a lot of, inspiration from Kevin Sztern's dotfiles repository:
  * https://github.com/Chewie/dotfiles

A simple repository with my dotfiles to install my configuration from a new system.

The script uses stow to make symlinks from the repository to your home, the purpose being to ease updating the
confifuration files. That means you *must not* remove the repository, or you will have to deal with dangling symlinks.

In case of a very fresh install, you should download the 'install.sh' file, execute it and then clone this repo.

Usage:
 To launch the full installation, run `./install.sh packages` *from* the root directory. You need stow to be installed
 to do so.
 To only link the configuration files, simply run `./install.sh`.

I advise you to make the repository itself a dotfile from your own home.
Be aware that my logins are hard written in some files!
